# Predictive Modeling for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using customer purchase history and behavior data from the "OnlineRetail.csv" dataset. By leveraging this predictive model, businesses can optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention efforts.

## Dataset
- **File**: OnlineRetail.csv
- **Encoding**: ISO-8859-1
- **Columns**:
  - **InvoiceNo**: Unique identifier for each transaction
  - **StockCode**: Product code
  - **Description**: Product description
  - **Quantity**: Number of items purchased
  - **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of purchase
  - **UnitPrice**: Price per unit
  - **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier
  - **Country**: Customer's country

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.7 or compatible version
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - joblib
  - (Additional libraries may be required based on model implementation, e.g., scikit-learn, plotly)

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas joblib
   ```
3. Download the dataset "OnlineRetail.csv" and place it in the project directory.

## Data Preprocessing
The notebook includes the following preprocessing steps:
1. **Loading Data**: Reads the dataset using pandas with ISO-8859-1 encoding.
2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Drops rows where `CustomerID` is missing.
   - Verifies no missing values remain.
3. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Converts `CustomerID` from float to integer.
4. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removes rows with negative `Quantity` values.
5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creates a `Revenue` column by multiplying `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.

## Methodology
- **Objective**: Predict CLV to inform marketing and retention strategies.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load and explore the dataset.
  2. Preprocess data (handle missing values, clean data, engineer features).
  3. (Note: RFM analysis and model training steps are incomplete in the provided notebook.)
  4. Visualize relationships, e.g., Recency vs. Monetary Value colored by Frequency.
  5. Save the trained model (if applicable) using joblib as 'clv_model.pkl'.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Predictive_Modeling_for_Customer_Lifetime_Value.ipynb`.
2. Ensure the "OnlineRetail.csv" file is in the same directory.
3. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Perform exploratory analysis.
   - (Complete the RFM analysis and model training as needed.)
   - Save the model for future use.
4. Review visualizations and model outputs to derive insights.

## Files
- **OnlineRetail.csv**: Raw dataset
- **Predictive_Modeling_for_Customer_Lifetime_Value.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis
- **clv_model.pkl**: Saved model file (generated after training)

## Notes
- The notebook is incomplete; RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and model training steps are missing.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed for visualization (e.g., plotly) and modeling libraries.
- Negative quantities were removed, but additional checks for `UnitPrice` or outliers may be needed.

## Future Improvements
- Complete RFM analysis to derive Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
- Implement a machine learning model (e.g., regression, XGBoost) for CLV prediction.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE or MAE.
- Add more visualizations for deeper insights into customer behavior.
